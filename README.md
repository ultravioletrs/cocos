## Introduction 🚀

Cocos AI is a **cutting-edge platform** designed to enable secure multiparty computation (SMPC) using **Confidential Computing** and **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.

It empowers organizations to collaboratively process sensitive data for AI/ML workloads while ensuring:

- 🔒 **Data Privacy**: Your data stays encrypted and secure throughout the computation.
- 🛡️ **Trust and Integrity**: Protected by hardware enclaves with robust remote attestation protocols.
- 🤝 **Seamless Collaboration**: Multiple organizations can work together without exposing sensitive information.

## Features 🛠️

Cocos AI provides essential features for secure and efficient collaborative AI/ML:

- 🖥️ **TEE Enablement and Monitoring**: Secure VM management for deploying and monitoring workloads.
- 🛡️ **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Built on a hardened Linux kernel, secure bootloader, and minimal root filesystem (minimal TCB).
- 🕵️ **In-Enclave Agent and Networking Controller**: Essential system software for managing secure workloads.
- 🔒 **Encrypted Data Transfer**: Asynchronous data transfer and secure result delivery.
- 🛠️ **API for Platform Manipulation**: Programmatic control for managing workloads.
- ✅ **Attestation and Verification Tools**: Hardware- and software-supported attestation for integrity assurance.
- 🖱️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A user-friendly CLI for system interaction.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Clone the Repository and Build Binaries
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ultravioletrs/cocos.git
make
```

This will generate three binaries:
```bash
ls build/
# cocos-agent  cocos-cli  cocos-manager
```

### Deployment Overview:
- **Manager**: Deploy on the AMD SEV-SNP host to orchestrate workloads.
- **Agent**: Build into the [EOS](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/eos)-based HAL for secure enclave management.
- **CLI**: Interact with remote agents to control operations.
