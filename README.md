With Cocos AI it becomes possible to run AI/ML workloads on combined datasets from multiple organizations
while guaranteeing the privacy and security of the data and the algorithms.
Data is always encrypted, protected by hardware secure enclaves (Trusted Execution Environments),
attested via secure remote attestation protocols, and invisible to cloud processors or any other
3rd party to which computation is offloaded.

## Usage

The quickest way to start using Cocos is via the CLI. The latest version can be downloaded from the [official releases page][rel].

It can also be built and used from the project's root directory:

```bash
make cli
./build/cocos-cli version
```

Additional details on using the CLI can be found in the [CLI documentation](https://docs.cocos.ai/cli).
